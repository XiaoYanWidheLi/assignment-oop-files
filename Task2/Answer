2. Is it possible in this design for an Engineer to also become a Manager?
-  No, engineer cannot become a Manager directly.
Because there is no provision for changing the role or type of an existing employee.
The Engineer and Manager classes extend the Employee class, which means they inherit the properties and behavior of the Employee class,
but they do not have a direct relationship with each other that would allow an instance of Engineer to become an instance of Manager.
